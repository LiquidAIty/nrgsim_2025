-------------------------------

== 1.5 beta 07, 23 September 2014 ==

New Features:

Parametric project
- @calc() syntax in parameter definition allows values to be calculated from a formula
- Extended RVI (.rvx) file for customizing result collection
- Calls Python scripts for post-processing during result collection
- Calculates user-defined variables after result collection
- Combined results table generated by default

GUI changes
- New text editor with syntax highlighting that works well with large model files
- Additional tools organized on the Utilities tabs

Utilities
- Run Python script for further analysis
- IDF version converter shell for easily updating projects to later E+ versions (Windows only)

== 1.5 preview 05, 22 October 2013 ==

New Features:

- New version converter GUI supports the E+ version updaters 
- New Python script executor GUI for running your own postprocessing scripts (see included examples)
- Experimental support for INSEL 8
- Fixed a bug in TRNSYS project result collection

== Version 1.4, 7 June 2013 ==

New Features:

  * Support combinatorial parameters, i.e. parameters containing two or more search strings and the corresponding value sets
  * Parameter definitions can be imported from and export to a CSV-styled text file, making the task of editing large number of parameters easier
  * Extracts simulation results from both ESO (using ReadVarsESO) and tabular (using SQLite) outputs
  * Result files can be merged into a single table, and openned directly in the associated program for CSV (e.g. Microsoft Excel) from the GUI
  * Complete overhaul of command-line options
  * Various improvements to the GUI
  * Bug fixes

== Version 1.3, 6 August 2012 ==

New Features:

  * jEPlus now supports TRNSYS parametrics!
  * Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is implemented, supporting Gaussian, Uniform, Triangular and Discrete distributions.
  * Resource and progress monitor is shown when running simulation jobs. It helps users keep an eye on memory and disk space during large parametrics. The monitor also allows you to pause and resume a batch, as well as throttling number of threads on-the-fly.
  * Project validation function has been revised. It can now handle practically infinite sized projects.
  * Post-process function provides a link between E+ and TRNSYS parametrics. This feature is experimental.
  * Various improvements to GUI.
  * Bug fixes.

  
== Version 1.2, 31 December 2011 ==

New Features:

  * Improved memory usage. You can now create a job batch in excess of 1 million jobs.
  * Better handling of directories. You can now (manually) specify relative directories for weather, IDF, RVI and output files. In this way, you can put all files in one folder and move it to another location; and everything should still work.
  * New feature for importing parameter definitions in a CSV-styled table. When you have many parameters, it is offen a pain to edit the parameter tree in the GUI. You can now import them from CSV-like text file, and a single-branch parameter tree will be generated from these parameters. See "examples/parameters.csv" for an example.
  * Exporting a project to an .obj file, which can then be loaded using a different mechanism. This is required if you want to use jEPlus with Matlab at programming level.
  * Batch job result now contains an index file, in which parameter values of each job are listed against the job ids.
  * Various GUI improvements, including adjustable left-right pane layout.

  
== Version 1.1, 15 July 2011 ==

New Features:

  * Improved IDF editor tab. The editor now reads search strings in the current jeplus project and locate them in the IDF file on opening. It also highlights E+ macro commands and the version line.
  * On the post-process tab, you can now obtain simple stats (mean, variance, min and max) from the simulation results of the project.
  * Other tweaks to the GUI, including improved checking of unsaved changes.

  
== Version 1.0a, 28 May 2011 ==

Additional Features to Version 1.0beta:

  * Command-line interface to run selected jobs. There are four ways to specify jobs to execute. Try "java -jar jEPlus.jar -help" for more details.
  * Improvement on jEPlus' memory usage when processing large projects
  * Some tweaks of the GUI

  
== Version 1.0 beta, 05 February 2011 ==

Features since Version 1.0:

  * Many improvements made to GUI
  * jEPlus project file (.jep) in XML format
  * Select and run a subset of the project by freezing parameters on selected values
  * Support for parameter value sampling with uniform or normal distributions
  * Support for loading parameter values from an external text file
  * Three 'test run' methods – the first job of each parameter chain; the first m jobs of the whole project; and the random samples (n jobs) of the whole project
  * Post-process tab allows extracting a different set of results from E+ outputs without re-running the simulations
  * Miscellaneous issues resolved


Features since Version 0.5 (released on 01 October, 2009):

  * UI layout change to support smaller screens (1024x768)
  * Stores information of local E+ installation
  * Support for EP-Macro (macro preprocessing) and HVACTemplates
  * Support for .IMF and .MVI file extensions
  * SQL script for collecting indices and E+ execution information
  * Improved validation failure feedback
  * Default settings and examples are now for E+ 3.1.0
  * Options to remove E+ temporary files
  * Improved user manual
  * Miscellaneous GUI issues resolved


Features of Version 0.1 (First released on 20 July, 2009):

  * Complete GUI provide setting up parametric runs with E+
  * Unique parameter tree for defining dependency between parameters
  * Flexible syntax for specifying alternative values
  * Supports multi-processor/multi-core systems by threading
  * Supports Windows/Mac/Linux versions of E+
  * In-built IDF editor supports basic syntax highlighting and incremental search
  * Simulation results are collected in CSV format (using ReadVarsESO) with index files
